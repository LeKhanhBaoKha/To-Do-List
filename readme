You have to use xampp with php verion >= 8.2
use this to run the backend with  xamp php -S localhost:8008 -t public

in the frontend run yarn watch and npm run dev to build tailwindcss

I use a font awsome package for Laravel called owenvoke/blade-fontawesome
you need to run composer require owenvoke/blade-fontawesome
and after that run php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-fontawesome-config
I also use laravel-notify package for this project no need to install I just say it to clear thing up.
