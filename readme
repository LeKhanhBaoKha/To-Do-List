use this to run the backend with  xamp php -S localhost:8008 -t public

in the frontend run yarn watch and npm run dev to build tailwindcss

I use a font awsome package for Laravel called Owenvoke
you need to run composer require owenvoke/blade-fontawesome
and after that run php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-fontawesome-config
